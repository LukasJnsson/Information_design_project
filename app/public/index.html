                    <h2>Can it affect me and why is it happening?</h2>

                    <p>Studies show that there is an severe increase in water levels throughout the world and Sweden. For this example 
                        we've decided to focus on the area of Skanör (located) where there is worries regarding the water levels going to high
                        which could force people to move because their houses are located where the water levels will be too high to live.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Questions regarding why this is happening, how fast it is happening and what we can do to prevent it will be presented through different
                        data visualisations.
                    </p>

                    <p>The biggest reason for water levels increasing are the Co2 (carbon) emissions throughout the world that results in raising temperatures
                        which in turn makes the ice caps melt and in result raise the ocean levels. It is difficult to change everything at once, so we will present 
                        how much different sectors output in Co2 and what you as an individual could do to prevent the number from increasing at such a rapid pace as it
                        has been previously.
                    </p>
