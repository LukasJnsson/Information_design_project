                        <h2>Can it affect me and why is it happening?</h2>

                        <p>Studies show that there is an severe increase in water levels throughout the world and Sweden. For this example 
                            we've decided to focus on the area of Skanör (located) where there is worries regarding the water levels going to high
                            which could force people to move because their houses are located where the water levels will be too high to live.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Questions regarding why this is happening, how fast it is happening and what we can do to prevent it will be presented through different
                            data visualisations.
                        </p>

                        <p>The biggest reason for water levels increasing are the Co2 (carbon) emissions throughout the world that results in raising temperatures
                            which in turn makes the ice caps melt and in result raise the ocean levels. It is difficult to change everything at once, so we will present 
                            how much different sectors output in Co2 and what you as an individual could do to prevent the number from increasing at such a rapid pace as it
                            has been previously.

                        <p>
                            This graph is meant to show how carbon emissions can change the water levels. To explain further, high carbon emissions contribute to raising the general temperature in the world. When this temperature is increased the ice caps melt which in turn increases the water levels around the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As presented here, there is a connection between flights and carbon emissions. More flights contribute to more carbon emissions. This graph shows the statistics for specifically Sweden, and as seen there were a lot of inbound flights in the early 2000s. However, it takes time (a couple of years) for the carbon emissions to actually change the atmosphere and increase the temperature, the earlier 2000s had an effect later on the water levels which have increased significantly in the last couple of years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flights are measured in landing frequency at all domestic airports. The graph shows all landings between 1997 and 2021 in Sweden. 
                            Carbon dioxide emissions are measured in thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e)
                            Sea level is measured in the climate-driven sea level change for Skanör (Annual average)
                        </p>

                            As seen there are a lot of different sectors that contribute to emissions in Sweden. However some more than others. The purpose of this is to present what sectors can make the biggest difference if we decrease emissions. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This pie chart presents the percentage of carbon emissions total by different sections from 1997 - 2022, and the biggest contributors are factories and inbound travel. In the case of inbound travel the biggest section that gives the most emissions are inbound flights, and can therefore be an area where we as individuals can make the biggest difference.

                        From the above data, several conclusions can be drawn. By minimizing unnecessary transport and consumption, we can contribute to minimize carbon dioxide emissions, which leads to maintained sea levels. Even if the data for the period after Covid-19 is smaller, positive changes regarding climate change are shown. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Taking the hour-long job meeting digitally instead of flying to meet physically is both economical, ecological and more time efficient. If everyone contributes with a small change in their everyday life, big changes will be seen nationally and we might see a decrease in sea level for future generations.
